# Welcome to Remix + Partyflare!

## Development

Run the dev server:

```sh
bun dev
```

## Deployment

If you don't already have an account, then [create a cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and set up your free custom Cloudflare Workers subdomain.

Once that's done, you should be able to deploy your app:

```sh
bun run deploy
```
